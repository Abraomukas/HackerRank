# Java End-of-file

The challenge here is to read **n** lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all **n** lines of content.


## Input format

Read some unknown **n** lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.


## Output format

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

## Sample input

```
Hello World
I am fine
Read me until end-of-file.
```

## Sample output

```
1 Hello World
2 I am fine
3 Read me until end-of-file.
```
