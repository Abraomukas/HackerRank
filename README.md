# Java Substring Comparisons

We define the following terms:

- Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows:

**A < B < ... < Y < Z < a < b < ... < y < z**

For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.

- A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string. For example, the substrings of abc are
  a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.

Given a string, **s**, and an integer, **k**, complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length **k**.

## Function Description

Complete the getSmallestAndLargest function in the editor below.

getSmallestAndLargest has the following parameters:

- string s: a string
- int k: the length of the substrings to find

## Returns

- string: the string ' + "\n" + ' where and are the two substrings

## Input format

The first line contains a string denoting **s**.

The second line contains an integer denoting **k**.

## Constraints

- 1 <= |s| <= 1000
- **s** consists of English alphabetic letters only (i.e., [a-zA-Z]).

## Sample input 0

```
welcometojava
3
```

## Sample output 0

```
ava
wel
```

## Explanation 0

String **s = "welcometojava"** has the following lexicographically-ordered substrings of length **k = 3**:

**["ava", "com", "elc", "eto", "jav", "lco", "met", "oja", "ome", "toj", "wel"]**

We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring, and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as
two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\nwel).

The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.
